    <h4 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">What Is Digital Marketing?</h4>
    <p class="text-body-blog"><i>This is a huge topic, so let's start by defining exactly what we mean when we talk about digital marketing.</i></p>
    <p class="text-body-blog"><b>Digital marketing is an umbrella term for all of your company's online marketing efforts. </b></p>

    <div class="clearfix"></div>

    <p class="text-body-blog">Lots of businesses leverage digital channels such as Google search, social media, email, online advertising and their websites to connect with their current and prospective customers. Many companies focus on online (or digital) channels over offline marketing tactics because it allows them to reach their ideal target audience where they're already spending most of their time: online.</p>


    <p class="text-body-blog">From your website itself to your online branding assets and social media channels -- digital advertising, email marketing, online brochures, and beyond -- there’s a huge spectrum of tactics and assets that fall under the umbrella of digital marketing. Yet the best digital marketers have a clear picture of how each asset or tactic supports their overarching goals.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Benefits of Digital Marketing</h2>
    <p class="text-body-blog">Let's cut to the chase; why should you start doing digital marketing?<br>
There's endless reasons why digital marketing makes an excellent solution for so many businesses, but if you're just getting started, here's the two that will have the biggest impact on the way you market and sell to your customers. </p>


    <h2 style="text-align: center;">1. Reach the right people, in the right place, at the right time</h2>
    <p class="text-body-blog">The internet is your gateway to people who might one day become your customers. With an online presence, you can reach far more of the right people than you can by marketing your company solely offline. And if you do it the right way, you can get in front of the people who are likely to become your customers at the right moment in their buyer’s journey. </p>
    <p class="text-body-blog">Direct mail and cold calling are outdated tactics. We spend an increasing amount of time on the internet, and we’re constantly using our smartphones. It’s a harsh truth: most people will miss the print ad or brochure you’re trying to put in front of them because they’re too busy looking at a digital screen. Either that, or they’ve subconsciously learned to ignore anything that looks too much like an advertisement.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">2. Get measurable results to inform your strategy</h2>
    <p class="text-body-blog">Another huge benefit is that digital marketing allows marketers to see accurate results in real time. If you’ve ever put an advert in a newspaper, you’ll know it's impossible to measure the impact that advert has on your business. On the other hand, with digital marketing, you can measure the ROI of pretty much any aspect of your marketing efforts using analytics software (like HubSpot). </p>
    <p class="text-body-blog">Marketing has always been about making a connection with your target audience in the right place, at the right time. Today, they’re online, and that means digital marketing should be a primary focus for your business.</p>
