    <h1>Choosing right “Logo” for Branding</h1>
    <p class="text-body-blog">A Picture speaks a thousand words, but Logos do something more, they define the firm better than anything. It is a symbol created for the purpose of identification. These are simple to look at but have a deep hidden meaning in them. These Logos need a lot of creativity and imagination to design them.</p>
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <img src="img/blog_1/1-01.png" class="img-responsive">
    </div>
    <p class="text-body-blog">mentioned, Logos should be creative and unique but how unique is what we will be discussing in this article. A Logo should be designed such that a person could associate it with a particular color or shape or a design. Hence, these 3; Color, Font and Shape play a major role in designing a Logo.</p>


    <p class="text-body-blog">Firstly, it’s the Color, which plays one of the important roles in Logo designing but it is usually misunderstood by people. Each color has a specific meaning. Choosing the right color helps you design the perfect Logo of your Brand.  Different colors have different meanings. The picture helps you in knowing the definitions for different colors.</p>


    <p class="text-body-blog">It has been known that 93% of purchases are made on visual perceptions and 84.5% of people consider color as the main reason for choosing any particular product. The best way to get recognized is to select one color. Just, One Color</p>

        <h4>Twitter Logo is a Logomark</h4>
    </div>

    <div class="clearfix"></div>


    <p class="text-body-blog">Fundamentally, Logotype is nothing but the Font which stands for the words or the name of the business designed in a customized way, whereas Logomark is a symbol which represents the business but does not include the business name. The difficult part here for any individual is deciding on what to choose- Logotype or Logomark. This totally depends on how an individual wants to use it for their business. However, choosing a Logomark would add an outstanding recognition for your brand. Sometimes, budget becomes a significant cost, for such, one could start a business simple and design a Logo once the business grows.</p>


    <p class="text-body-blog">The main criterion for designing Logo is recognition. Here are some of the logos which are very creative explaining either the nature of business or that gives a visual representation of the name.</p>

    <p class="text-body-blog">The Apple Logo clearly represents the name of the company. Even though the original logo for Apple featured an image of Sir Issac Newton, the only reason that the fruit was picked as logo was that Steve Jobs likes the sound of it- APPLE. There were other Myths that the bite mark represents the apple of knowledge from the Garden of Eden but the bite mark was given for the logo scale so people might not confuse it for a cherry.</p>

    <p class="text-body-blog">As seen above, Logos play a critical feature in business. They are considered as the “Face” of the company. Logos can be identified at a glance and have enormous marketing power. The best way to protect the logos from being used by others is to Trademark it. Trademark helps in different ways,</p>
    <p class="text-body-blog">1.    Distinguishing the products/services from the competitors; helps your products/services stand out.<br>
2.  It helps you defend the company’s logo through legal action by letting it know the fact that the logo is yours and it is original.<br>
3.  It helps in preventing infringement of the owner’s goods.
</p>
    <p class="text-body-blog">Hence, choosing the right logo helps in identifying your business and also you will have a legal evidence of ownership of the mark.</p>
